# Music Scales - A GNOME-Shell Extension

This is a simple GNOME applet which displays the notes of a musical scale for quick reference. You can select the root note and a scale type (e.g, Natural Minor, Dorian, etc), and the notes of the scale will be highlighted on a one-octave depiction of a piano keyboard:

It's intended to be handy for looking up which notes are in-scale if you're making music.

# TODO

- Add more scales/modes
- Add I18N support
